Easy Element will rebuild your web component(s) to the `dist` folder, then your browser should refresh the demo page automatically. Your terminal will report build failures due to HTML/CSS/JS syntax errors.

Note that you have two demo pages: `dist/index.class.html` for new browsers, and `dist/index.es5.html` for a wider range of browser support. By default your browser will open the page which uses class-based JavaScript output.
